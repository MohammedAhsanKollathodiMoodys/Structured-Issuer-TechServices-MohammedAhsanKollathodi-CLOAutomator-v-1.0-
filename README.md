# Structured-Issuer-TechServices-MohammedAhsanKollathodi-CLOAutomator-v-1.0-
CLOAutomator v1.0 is designed to automate CLO monitoring, with basic functionalities and key information integrated into a monitoring and control panel.

**pre-requisite : **
python -m pip install PyQt5



**Project Overview : **
We plan to automate CLO monitoring and analysis through various methods, as discussed during the initial years. The automated system is expected to produce more accurate results with fewer errors, displayed on a dynamic web page that refreshes every 30 minutes or after each cluster run, incorporating new data. Additional exciting features can also be integrated over time. Alternatively, a desktop application could serve the purpose just as well. 


**Recent Updates **

- S3 notification alerts were implemented to notify the arrival of various trigger files for multiple clients. Further enhancements are currently in progress.

- A wireframe was developed for the CLO Control and Monitoring Panel application and reviewed by the team.

- The GUI has been implemented using Python and related libraries such as PyQt5 and is currently in its initial phase.
